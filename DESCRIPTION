Description: Reads data from Bruker OPUS binary files of Fourier-Transform
    infrared spectrometers of the company Bruker Optics GmbH & Co.
    This package is released independently from Bruker, and Bruker and OPUS are
    registered trademarks of Bruker Optics GmbH & Co. KG.
    <https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/infrared-and-raman/opus-spectroscopy-software/latest-release.html>.
    It lets you import both measurement data and parameters from OPUS files.
    The main method is `read_opus()`, which reads one or multiple OPUS files
    into a standardized list class. Behind the scenes, the reader parses the
    file header for assigning spectral blocks and reading binary data from the
    respective byte positions, using a reverse engineering approach. Infrared
    spectroscopy combined with chemometrics and machine learning is an
    established method to scale up chemical diagnostics in various industries
    and scientific fields.
