# Motivation

Spectrometers from [Bruker® Optics GmbH & Co.
KG](https://www.bruker.com/en.html) save spectra in a binary file format known
as OPUS. Each OPUS file corresponds to one sample measurement, typically
acquired through the OPUS spectroscopy software. These files feature numerical
extensions, with extension numbers incrementing based on the naming scheme
chosen in the OPUS software.

The OPUS suite and the file specification are proprietary, leading to the need
for an implementation based on reverse engineering in this package. With
{opusreader2}, you can access your spectroscopic data in the open computing
language R, providing full control over your spectral data workflow. Our package
specifically reads binary files for most Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR)
spectrometers from Bruker® Optics GmbH. While it may work for other products
like Raman spectrometers, further adjustments are required to support new block
types (data and parameters; see below).

# OPUS data extraction

The processing of each OPUS file begins by extracting essential information from
a designated byte range in the file header. This section contains crucial
details about binary blocks (also called chunks), including byte offsets, sizes,
and data types within the file. The parsing algorithm utilizes this information
to extract modular blocks of data and parameters from byte sequences. As
illustrated in the figure below, the content of the files varies based on the
instrument type, user-selected data (spectrum) blocks to save, and specific
settings.

In addition to result spectra, the binary files encompass:

-   a comprehensive set of measurement parameters (configurations, conditions)

-   single-channel data from background measurements done before the sample

-   other types of intermediate spectra. Currently, we support *"data blocks to
    be saved* *"* for fourier-transform infrared spectrometers.

## Reading and parsing OPUS files in R

With the main function `read_opus()` you can either read single or multiple OPUS
files. Let's take an example file produced by a Bruker ALPHA® spectrometer that
measures mid-infrared spectra with a diffuse-reflectance accessory. This
spectral measurement of a soil sample comes with the package and is also part of
the data set in Baumann et al. (2020). Here is how OPUS software represents
parsed blocks in the OPUS viewer software from Bruker®.

We can extract all those blocks from the corresponding OPUS file example. We can
even explore additional blocks that are not visually displayed in the official
software but are present in the file (more details below).

```{r}
library("opusreader2")
# example file
file_1 <- system.file("extdata", "test_data", "BF_lo_01_soil_cal.1",
  package = "opusreader2"
)
spectrum_1 <- read_opus(dsn = file_1)
```

The `dsn` argument provides is the data source name. It is currently either a
character vector of the folder path to read files from recursively, or character
vector of specific OPUS file paths.

**`read_opus()`** returns a nested list of class `"list_opusreader2"`.

```{r}
class(spectrum_1)
names(spectrum_1)
```

At the first level of the list output, data is arranged as shown in the Bruker
OPUS viewer.

```{r}
meas_1 <- spectrum_1[["BF_lo_01_soil_cal.1"]]
names(meas_1)
```

To learn about block names, associated data, and parameters, we suggest
consulting th documentation via `?read_opus`. We've formatted the block names in
`camel_case` within the second level of the `"opusreader2_list"` output,
facilitating improved programmatic access.

Printing the complete `"opusreader2_list"` object in the R console keeps the
console occupied for a significant amount of time. For more efficient
examination in RStudio, we recommend using the *list preview* feature with
`View(spectrum_1)`, accessible through the *Environment* tab. Here we employ
base R subsetting, `names()`, and `str()` to explore examples of measured
spectral data.

This output reveals three list elements that may not be visible in the Bruker®
viewer pane.

1.  `basic_metadata`: This data frame serves as minimal metadata to identify
    measurements. It contains the file name at time of parsing, the sample name
    entered prior measurement, and different time stamps. This field is for
    example useful to build data pipelines for spectral libraries and prediction
    services.
2.  `ab_no_atm_comp_data_param`: Parameters for the absorbance (AB) block prior
    to atmospheric compensation.
3.  `ab_no_atm_comp`:

```{r}
str(meas_1$basic_metadata)
```

All types of data and parameters within OPUS files are encoded with three
capital letters each. We can for example verify the frequency of the first point
(`FXV`).

```{r}
meas_1$ab_data_param$parameters$FXV$parameter_value
```

Besides the data or parameter values, the output of each parsed OPUS block
contains the block type, channel type, text type, additional type, the offset in
bytes, next offset in bytes, and the chunk size in bytes for particular data
blocks. This is decoded from the file header and allows to trace the parsing
process.

```{r}
class(meas_1$ab_data_param)
str(meas_1$ab_data_param)
```

```{r}
str(meas_1$instrument)
```

The first example mid-infrared spectrum was measured with atmospheric
compensation (carbon dioxide and water bands), which is done on based on the
background spectra. The measurement option is called "Atmospheric compensation"
in the OPUS software. The goal of this routine is to remove artefacts from CO2
and water bands in the measurement module. Generally, OPUS files have trace
every step or macro applied in the file output. Reading both raw and transformed
data gives us flexibility and the possibility to do extended quality control
prior to further data processing, modeling, and estimating new samples.

## Reading OPUS files recursively from folder

A data source name (`dsn`) can be a folder, too. This makes it convenient to
read all OPUS files located below a certain folder level. We illustrate it with
all OPUS test files that come with {opusreader2}, which are are also used in
unit tests.

```{r}
test_dsn <- system.file("extdata", "test_data", package = "opusreader2")
data_test <- read_opus(dsn = test_dsn)
names(data_test)
```

We can get the instrument name of the test files like this.

```{r}
get_instrument_name <- function(data) {
  return(data$instrument$parameters$INS$parameter_value)
}

lapply(data_test, get_instrument_name)
```

## Reading OPUS files in parallel

## Reading a single OPUS file

For single OPUS files, there `read_opus_single()` implementation can also be
used

```{r}
data_single <- read_opus_single(dsn = file_1)
```
