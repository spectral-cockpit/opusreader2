Bruker OPUS is a proprietary file format to store all measurement parameters,
configurations, environmental conditions, and spectral data types saved.
The file format is produced by the Bruker OPUS software.

## Basic usage

```{r}
library("opusreader2")
file <- opus_file()
data_list <- read_opus(file)
```

`read_opus` is a list-parser using S3 classes. The data is arranged
as shown in the Bruker OPUS viewer:

```{r}
names(data_list)
```
