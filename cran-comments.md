## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Addressed feedback from the initial CRAN submission review:
  * Hydrated the Description field, i.e. added details about what the package
    does and how it is useful. I further added a reference URL to the Bruker
    OPUS software producing the Bruker OPUS binary files.
  * Added return values for the exported methods `print.list_opusreader2()`
    and `read_opus_single()`.
